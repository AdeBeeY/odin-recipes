# odin-recipes
This project is basically putting to use all that i have learnt in html. I am required to choose about three different recipes of my choice, describe them, attach their images, list the ingredients in making them, itemize the steps required to prepare them, and push the final result to my github account.
So, i am working on Efo Riro, Egusi Soup, and Waakye.
In this project, i used <strong> <b> <em> <i> <ins> <del> <mark> <h1> through <h4> and <p> strictly html attibutes.
